# Built With

Open-source software that `doc-example` 6 depends on, links against, ships within, or invokes at runtime.

Three layers of attribution ship with each release:

- [Software Bill of Materials (CycloneDX, JSON)](bom.json)[1] — full transitive dependency graph with SPDX-normalized licenses and artifact hashes. Ingestible by Dependency-Track, Trivy, Snyk, GitHub’s dependency graph.
- [Licenses (SPDX)](licenses.html)[2] — human-readable SPDX-grouped view of declared dependencies, generated from `bom.json` (#335).
- This page — curated companion covering what mechanical reports can’t see (Maven Site skin, external services, fonts inside artifacts, frontend assets in rendered HTML).
